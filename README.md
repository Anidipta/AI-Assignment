# Project Title: Ball Tracking and Event Detection in Video 

## Objective:
Develop a computer vision program to track the movement of balls of different colors across various quadrants in a video. The program will record events of each ball entering and exiting each numbered quadrant and save the details in a specified format. The processed video will display the tracking information and overlay text indicating entry or exit events.

## Output:

### Processed Video:

* Tracks balls with their colors.
* Overlays text “Entry” or “Exit” with a timestamp when a ball enters or exits a quadrant.

### Text File:

* Records events in the format: Time, Quadrant Number, Ball Colour, Type (Entry or Exit).
